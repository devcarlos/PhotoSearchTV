Legrand (thanks for 6 M+ views)<\/a> posted a photo:<\/p> <p><a href=\"https:\/\/www.flickr.com\/photos\/capepaperu\/52300609095\/\" title=\"Snow leopards, Panthera uncia\"><img src=\"https:\/\/live.staticflickr.com\/65535\/52300609095_f806d760f7_m.jpg\" width=\"240\" height=\"160\" alt=\"Snow leopards, Panthera uncia\" \/><\/a><\/p> <p>Snow leopards live in Central Asian mountain ranges like the Altai, Pamir, Hindu Kush and Himalayas at altitudes of 1,500 metres to as high as 6,000 metres in the summer months. Unlike other big cats such as lions, snow leopards prefer the cold. Thick coats of fur that cover their entire body provide optimum protection for life in the snow and ice. Even the undersides of their feet are covered in fur, and their particularly wide paws act like snow shoes in the deep snow. They use their long, bushy tails for balance when jumping and as a source of heat. When they lie down curled up, they place the tip of their tail over their nose to heat up the air, making it easier to breathe.
